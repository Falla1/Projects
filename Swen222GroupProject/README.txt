Hello!

To run the game all you need to do is run "Main" in the Game Package, hit start and the Server will be running, then run  "Main" again
and select 'connect', type 'localhost' in the text box and you're away. Repeat this for each subsequent player (Max 2).

Make sure the images,DataStorage and instructionsFromGod are in /src/ folder next to the jar as we were having trouble with relative locations

Read the 'God' tips ingame if you get stuck.

Have fun!

Thanks,

Group 211
